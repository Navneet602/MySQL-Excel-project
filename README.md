# MySQL-Excel-project
In this project I have to make a bar chart report for Fiscal year 2021 for the top 10 markets by % net sales.
I took Data Set of Atliq Hardware from Kaggle. 
In this project there were 7 csv files having 6 dimension tables and 1 fact table. I first imported these files into MySQL and clean the data like 0 values, null values etc.
As there were different data in different tables so I merged the tables using joins to get my results and also the temporary tables that I have created in my queries, I have to use it again in my next queries so I created views to use the temporary tables again and again. 
After getting my main result that is percentage Net Sales. Then I exported my data to my excel and made a bar chart.
