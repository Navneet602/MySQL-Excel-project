# MySQL-Excel-project
In this project, I undertook the task of analyzing the net sales data for Atliq Hardware for the fiscal year 2021 across its top 10 markets. Utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle, consisting of seven CSV files comprising six dimension tables and one fact table, I employed MySQL for data processing and analysis.

1. **Data Cleaning and Integration:**
The initial phase involved importing the disparate CSV files into MySQL and meticulously cleaning the data to rectify issues such as null values and zeros. With distinct datasets spread across multiple tables, I employed various SQL joins to integrate the data effectively, ensuring a cohesive analysis.

2. **Query Optimization and Views:**
Given the necessity to reuse temporary tables generated during intermediate queries, I optimized the process by creating views. These views allowed seamless access to the necessary data structures, streamlining subsequent analyses and enhancing overall efficiency.

3. **Analytical Insights:**
The primary objective was to ascertain the percentage of net sales for the top 10 markets of Atliq Hardware during the fiscal year 2021. By executing complex SQL queries and aggregations, I derived the desired insights, which formed the basis of subsequent visualization efforts.

4. **Visualization and Reporting:**
Upon obtaining the key metrics, I exported the data to Excel for further manipulation and visualization. Leveraging Excel's capabilities, I crafted a visually intuitive chart reports showcasing the net sales percentages across the top 10 markets, thereby facilitating clear and concise communication of the analytical findings.

Conclusion:
Through meticulous data processing, integration, and analysis, this project enabled a comprehensive understanding of Atliq Hardware's net sales performance across its primary markets in fiscal year 2021. The utilization of MySQL for data manipulation and Excel for visualization exemplified the synergy between database management and analytical tools in extracting actionable insights from complex datasets..
